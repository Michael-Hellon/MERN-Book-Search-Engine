# MERN-Book-Search-Engine
This project application started with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a MERN stack that allows users to save book searches to the back end, I refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server and deployed it to Render.

## Description

This project allows a user to search Google Book's vast library to find something to read and save books to a "Saved Books" list. Originally this application used a MERN stack that allows users to save book searches to the back end, I refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server and deployed it to Render. 

- I learned a lot from this project. I learned how to refractor a MERN full stack program to use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server
